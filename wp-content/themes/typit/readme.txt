== Description ==

Typit is a content focused WordPress theme that is designed to look great with or without images. There has been a growing trend with blogs without featured images, which makes this the perfect theme if you simply want to write articles. However, we still made it so that if you decide to incorporate features images, you can. We've also made the top header area to be flexible beyond belief--also with or without images. The future of WordPress is with Gutenberg editor, and with Typit you can experience the new editor with this theme. Of course, Typit also works excerptionally well with the Classic editor as well.
